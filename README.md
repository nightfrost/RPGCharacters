The user can create between 3 different classes, namely:
* mage

Each character can wear different armor-sets, that in turn makes them stronger. Characters
can also level up and become stronger.

There are 3 different types of armor:
* Cloth
* Leather
* Plate

There are also 3 different types of weapons:
* Melee
* Ranged
* Magic

The character is limited to 3 types of armors equipped, and one weapon. The character can equip new items, which will simply replace the item, and update the stats.
Both the hero and the items stats can change, depending on what level they are.
